# Credit-Risk-Classification

Module 20 Challenge: UWA/edx Data Analytics Bootcamp

Github repository at: https://github.com/RyanLJames1997/Credit-Risk-Classification

## Introduction

## Scope

In this challenge, as a data analyst, a variety of techniques will be implemented to train and evaluate a model based on [loan risk] based on a historical lending dataset. 

The historical data is sourced from a peer-to-peer lending services company.

Historical data, and features include:
    - Loan size
    - Interest rates
    - Borrower income
    - Debt to income ratio
    - Number of accounts
    - Derogatory remarks
    - Total debt
    - Loan status
    
 - Furthermore, the ['loan_status'] column will be used as the ['target']. The target column has 77526 total rows with 75036 labelled as ['healthy loans'] (0) and 2500 labelled as ['high-risk loans'].
    
 - The remaining columns will be identified as ['features'] in this supervised ['machine_learning'] prediction model.

### Goal

The overall goal of this analysis is to see if we can predict whether a credit loan is ['healthy'] or ['high-risk'] using the logistic regression method.

### Dataset

The dataset was generated by the team at **edX Boot Camps LLC** and **Mockaroo LLC 2022**
