# Credit-Risk-Classification

Module 20 Challenge: UWA/edx Data Analytics Bootcamp

Github repository at: https://github.com/RyanLJames1997/Credit-Risk-Classification

## Introduction

## Scope

In this challenge, as a data analyst, a variety of techniques will be implemented to train and evaluate a model based on `loan risk` based on a historical lending dataset. 

The historical data is sourced from a peer-to-peer lending services company.

Historical data, and features include:

        - Loan size
        - Interest rates
        - Borrower income
        - Debt to income ratio
        - Number of accounts
        - Derogatory remarks
        - Total debt
        - Loan status

Furthermore, the `loan_status` column will be used as the `target`, and the remaining columns will be identified as `features` in this supervised `machine_learning` prediction model.

### Goal

The overall goal of this analysis is to see if we can predict whether a credit loan is `healthy` or `high-risk` using the logistic regression method. 

### Repository Structure

- The root directory that contains the source code: `credit_risk_classification.ipynb`

- The `Resources` directory contains the raw dataset used in the model 

### Dataset

The dataset was generated by the team at **edX Boot Camps LLC** and **Mockaroo LLC 2022**
